BDT (Boosted Decision Tree) training for gamma-hadron separation
================================================================
Author: K. Kosack <karl.kosack@cea.fr>

To use this, just copy Makefile.BDT to your working directory (As
Makefile), and copy or link showseparation.py and classify_base.c there also.

Then, edit the Makefile to specify the event-lists to use for testing
and training, and finally run:

      make sepration.pdf

which will run all steps necessary to train the BDT, and produce a
plot of the gamma-hadron separation power.



NOTE: this assumes you have JBoost installed somewhere and have your
jave CLASSPATH variable set to include it.
